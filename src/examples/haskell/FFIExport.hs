{- | FFIExport.hs - Haskell functions exported for C/C++

This module demonstrates exporting Haskell functions to C/C++
via the ForeignFunctionInterface extension.

When compiled with haskell_c_library, GHC generates:
  - A static library (.a) containing the Haskell runtime and code
  - Header files (*_stub.h) declaring the exported functions

C/C++ code can then link against this library and call the
exported functions, as long as it initializes the Haskell
runtime with hs_init() first.
